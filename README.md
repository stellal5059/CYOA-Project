##Purpose:  
The purpose of this project was to show our understanding in using Git & Github as well as markdown techniques. We were able to create a choose your own adventure story from scratch using what we know to link different files and connect the story together. By using our knowledge of coding and Pokemon we were able to recreate a version of the Pokemon adventure thats different from the video games.
